# Title
Microservices with Spring Boot gRPC

## Context
Q: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

A: **The decision to migrate from a monolithic architecture to microservices with Spring Boot gRPC is driven by the need for scalability, flexibility, and performance in our Fintech project. As our project grows, managing a monolithic system becomes increasingly complex and difficult to maintain. We need a solution that allows us to break down our system into smaller, independently deployable services while ensuring efficient communication and high performance.**

## Decision
Q: What is the solution that we're proposing and/or doing?

A: **Our solution involves migrating from the monolithic architecture to microservices architecture using Spring Boot and gRPC. This approach allows us to design our system as a collection of small, loosely coupled services that communicate via a high-performance RPC framework. By leveraging gRPC, we can achieve faster communication between services while maintaining compatibility with a variety of programming languages and platforms.**

## Rationale
Q: Why do we choose this solution?

**A: We choose this solution for several reasons:**
- **Performance:** gRPC offers lightweight and efficient communication between microservices, making it ideal for high-performance applications.
- **Polyglot Persistence:** With microservices architecture, we can adopt polyglot persistence, allowing each service to use the most appropriate database technology for its specific needs.
- **Flexibility:** Microservices architecture provides flexibility in development and deployment, allowing teams to work independently on different services and scale components as needed.
- **Future-Proofing:** By adopting microservices architecture, we future-proof our system and make it easier to adapt to changing requirements and technologies.

## Consequences
Q: Pros – What becomes easier?

### Pros
- **Scalability:** Think of our system like a growing plant. With microservices, we can nurture each part independently, making sure they get just the right amount of water and sunlight. This means better performance and less stress on the system as it expands.
- **Flexibility:** Imagine our project as a Lego set. Microservices are like individual Lego bricks that we can easily swap out or add to without messing up the entire structure. This lets us experiment with new tools and techniques without breaking everything.
- **CI/CD:** Picture our development process like a well-oiled machine. With microservices, we can fine-tune each part separately, making updates and improvements without disrupting the whole operation. It's like upgrading the engine of a car while it's still running.
- **Agility:** Our project is like a dynamic dance routine. Microservices let us move and groove with the music, adapting to changes and adding new moves without missing a beat. It's like being able to improvise and innovate on the fly.
- **Database:** Think of our data as a library with different sections for books, magazines, and newspapers. Microservices allow us to organize our library more efficiently, with each section using the best storage system for its materials. It's like having a digital librarian who knows exactly where everything belongs.
- **Testing:** Consider our project like a jigsaw puzzle. Microservices are like individual pieces that we can test and validate independently before putting the whole picture together. It's like making sure each puzzle piece fits perfectly before completing the masterpiece.
- **Hosting:** Imagine our project as a group of friends planning a party. Microservices let us choose the perfect venue for each activity, ensuring that everything runs smoothly and everyone has a great time. It's like picking the right location for each part of the celebration.
- **Schedule:** Our project is like a team of athletes training for a big competition. Microservices allow us to customize our training regimen for each player, maximizing performance and efficiency. It's like tailoring our practice sessions to fit each team member's strengths and weaknesses.
- **Version Control:** Think of our project like a story with many chapters. Microservices allow us to manage and track changes to each part of the story separately, ensuring that everyone stays on the same page. It's like having a shared notebook where we can jot down ideas and revisions for each chapter.

Q: Cons – What becomes more difficult?

### Cons
- **High Cohesion:** Imagine our project as a group project in college. With microservices, it's like everyone working on their own assignment without knowing what the others are doing. It can be challenging to keep everyone aligned and ensure that all the pieces fit together seamlessly.
- **Autonomous:** Think of our project as a symphony orchestra. Each microservice is like a musician playing their instrument, but they need to follow the conductor's lead to stay in harmony. It can be tricky to ensure that each service operates independently while still working together towards a common goal.
- **Business Domain Centric:** Consider our project like a foreign language class. Microservices require a deep understanding of the business logic, just like learning the grammar and vocabulary of a new language. It can be complex to design services that accurately reflect the real-world requirements of our project.
- **Resilience:** Picture our project like a game of Jenga. Microservices are like individual blocks, and if one block falls, it shouldn't bring down the whole tower. It can be difficult to design a system that can withstand failures in one part without affecting the rest.

**Additional:** Resilience is how you handle downtime situations and maintain services that crash. There are various patterns and strategies for ensuring resilience in a microservices architecture.
